    <h1>My first HTML assignment</h1>
    <h3>lets start my assignment and try out things i learned so far</h3>

    <p>
      Once upon a time there was a wise man called Endre that said: "Do not use
      Chat GPT to learn how to write your codes". And then there was actually
      another wise man called Joe that said "you have to train your muscle
      memory". So therefore i will have to write it all myself and hopefully in
      the end i will feel little bit like the guy to the left on picture below,
      and hopefully not too much like the guy to the right:

    <button>Click here if i look like a hero until now</button> or
    <button>Click here if i look like a clown until now</button>

    <div class="flexbox-container">
      <div class="flexbox-item 1">Total votes:</div>
      <div class="flexbox-item 2">hero: 2</div>
      <div class="flexbox-item 3">Clown: 0</div>
    </div>

    <p>
      Above this text u can see my first flex-box. Inside the flexbox u can see
      total voters. Unfortunately its been only 2 voters until now, Endre and
      Joe! And hopefully they did not vote for Hero just because i called them
      wise
    </p>

    <p class="p-color">
      I also learned how to change look on my text. And how to change color on
      whatever text i want. For example to this annoying color on the text u
      read now!
    </p>
    <p>
      And i also learned a new, funny language/dummytext called Lorem and it
      looks like this: Lorem ipsum dolor sit, amet consectetur adipisicing elit.
      Enim libero deleniti in eos sint nobis natus dolore aliquid iste minus
      inventore, praesentium placeat, quas, officia tempore sapiente quos
      molestias possimus!
